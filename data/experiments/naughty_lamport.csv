What are the main features of Ragas?,"- organized around experiments, datasets, and metrics.","Ragas, a foundational concept in Indian classical music, encompass several main features:

1. **Melodic Framework**: A ragas provides a specific set of notes (svaras) and the relationships between them, usually derived from a scale like the major or minor scale but uniquely organized.

2. **Arohana and Avarohana**: Each raga has an ascending (Arohana) and descending (Avarohana) structure, defining the order in which notes are played in each direction.

3. **Vadi and Samvadi**: The raga features a dominant note (Vadi) which is the most emphasized during performance, alongside a second-most important note (Samvadi) that complements the Vadi.

4. **Pakad**: A catchy melodic phrase or motif that encapsulates the essence of the raga is known as the Pakad. It serves as a mnemonic device for musicians.

5. **Rasa and Emotion**: Each raga is associated with specific emotions or feelings (Rasa), allowing performers to evoke particular moods in their audience.

6. **Time of Day/Season**: Many ragas are traditionally tied to specific times of day or seasons, enhancing their emotional impact when performed at the appropriate times.

7. **Improvisation**: While ragas provide a framework, they also allow for significant improvisation, enabling musicians to express individuality and creativity.

These features together define the unique character of each raga, making the exploration of ragas a profound experience in Indian music.",fail
